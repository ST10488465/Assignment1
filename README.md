The meals app that I have created aids customers by allowing them to enter their time of day e.g. Breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, mid-day snack, dinner, and dessert. It then gives the customers suggestions on what to have for the specific time of day. It connects to food databases and services to provide an enormous number of meal ideas. Since it retains the code and promotes effortless communication among developers, GitHub is vital to the app's development. It helps manage tasks and documentation, tracks changes, and guarantees the app is automatically tested with every update via GitHub Actions. By hindering who can make changes while setting guidelines to avoid mistakes, GitHub further assures security. Personalized meal plans, meal reminders, and other features could be added to the app.
