The Meals App's goal is to provide individualized meal suggestions according to the time of day. By recommending breakfast, lunch, mid day snack, dinner, and dessert options based on the user's schedule, dietary preferences, and possibly even nutritional needs, this software seeks to maximize daily meal planning. To offer a large selection of meal recommendations, the app can be connected with other databases or APIs. Additionally, GitHub and GitHub Actions can be used to effectively manage the app's development, deployment, and maintenance.

GITHUB
GitHub is essential to the Meal Suggestion App's management since it offers automated workflows, version control, and collaborative capabilities. The source code for the application is kept in a GitHub repository, which enables numerous developers to collaborate at once by branching and merging while keeping track of changes through commits. With project boards for task management and pull requests for code reviews, GitHub makes collaboration easier. In order to automate testing, creating, and deploying the application to various environments, it also interfaces with GitHub Actions. Furthermore, GitHub facilitates documentation and helps with project management by prioritizing activities using milestones and labels. By limiting repository access and implementing branch protection guidelines, GitHub maintains security. As an application develops, GitHub assists in maintaining a high-quality, safe, and deployable application through automated code quality checks. All things considered, GitHub facilitates development, enhances teamwork, and guarantees that the application is reliably tested, updated, and effectively deployed.
